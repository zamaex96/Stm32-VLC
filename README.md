VLC communication modules to transmit data using the stm32 platform.

# Summary 

## Overview
The provided C code is a main program for an embedded system likely running on an STM32 microcontroller. It utilizes UART communication between two devices (`USART1` and `USART2`) and employs DMA for efficient data handling. The code includes functions for UART initialization, DMA setup, GPIO configuration, and system clock configuration.

## Key Components
- **UART Communication:** Two UART interfaces (`USART1` and `USART2`) are initialized for bidirectional communication using DMA for both receiving and transmitting data.
- **DMA Configuration:** Direct Memory Access (DMA) channels (`DMA1_Channel5` and `DMA1_Channel6`) are set up to handle UART data transfers in a non-blocking manner.
- **GPIO Configuration:** Configures GPIO pins (`PA13` and `PA14`) for general purpose and input/output operations.
- **System Clock:** Configures the system clock using MSI oscillator, ensuring proper timing for UART and other peripherals.

## Functions
- **Main Function (`main`):** Contains an infinite loop (`while(1)`) where UART data reception (`HAL_UART_Receive_DMA`) and transmission (`HAL_UART_Transmit`) are handled. It calls various functions like `CT_engine`, `SC_Estimator`, `MLC_Engine`, and others for data processing and communication.
- **Data Processing Functions:** Includes functions like `MLC`, `SC_Estimator`, `EGC_Estimator`, `find_best_CT`, and `CT_engine` for performing operations such as Mean of Least Change (MLC), Signal Change (SC) estimation, and Edge Change (EGC) estimation based on received data.

## Error Handling
- **Error Handler (`Error_Handler`):** Basic error handler that halts the program in case of an error occurrence, disabling interrupts and entering an infinite loop.

## License and Attribution
The code includes a copyright notice from STMicroelectronics and references to licensing terms in a LICENSE file. It assumes a permissive licensing model if no LICENSE file is present.

## Notes
- The code demonstrates advanced techniques like DMA-driven UART communication, efficient data processing algorithms for embedded systems, and robust error handling for reliable operation.
- It is structured for real-time applications where data integrity and timing are critical, leveraging hardware features of the STM32 microcontroller effectively.
